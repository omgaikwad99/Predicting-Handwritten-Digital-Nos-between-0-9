Running the Model
Follow these steps to run the deep learning model:

Data Preparation:

Organize your dataset into training and testing sets.
Convert your images into NumPy arrays and preprocess them as needed (e.g., scaling pixel values to [0, 1]).
One-hot encode your class labels for training and testing data.

Model Configuration:

Open the Python script containing the model code (assignment_2.py).
Customize the model hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) as needed.
Model Training:

Run the model by pressing teh play button on each code snippet or by the run-all command.
The training process will begin. You can monitor the progress through the console output.

Model Evaluation:

After training, the model will be evaluated on the test dataset.
The test accuracy, F1 score, ROC curve, and AUC will be displayed in the console.
Performance Visualization:

Training and validation loss plots will be generated and displayed.
